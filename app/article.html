					<p>“George, I wish you’d look at the nursery. “What’s wrong with it?”</p>
					<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
					<p>“Well, then.”</p>
					<p>“I just want you to look at it, is all, or call a psychologist in to look at it.” “What would a psychologist want with a nursery?”</p>
					<p>“You know very well what he’d want.” His wife was standing in the middle of the kitchen watching the stove busy humming to itself, making supper for four.</p>
					<p>“It’s just that it is different now than it was.”</p>
					<p>“All right, let’s have a look.”</p>
					<p>They walked down the hall of their HappyLife Home, which had cost them thirty thousand dollars with everything included. This house which clothed and fed and rocked them to sleep and played and sang and was good to them. Their approach was sensed by a hidden switch and the nursery light turned on when they came within ten feet of it. Similarly, behind them, in the halls, lights went on and off automatically as they left them behind.</p>
					<p>“Well,” said George Hadley. They stood on the grass-like floor of the nursery. It was forty feet across by forty feet long and thirty feet high; it had cost half again as much as the rest of the house. “But nothing’s too good for our children,” George had said.</p>
					<p>The room was silent and empty. The walls were white and two dimensional. Now, as George and Lydia Hadley stood in the center of the room, the walls made a quiet noise and seemed to fall away into the distance. Soon an African veldt appeared, in three dimensions, on all sides, in color. It looked real to the smallest stone and bit of yellow summer grass. The ceiling above them became a deep sky with a hot yellow sun.</p>
					<p>George Hadley started to sweat from the heat. “Let’s get out of this sun,” he said. “This is a little too real. But I don’t see anything wrong.”</p>
					<p>“Wait a moment, you’ll see,” said his wife.</p>
