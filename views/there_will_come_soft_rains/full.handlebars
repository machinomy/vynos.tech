        <br>
        <span>In the kitchen the breakfast stove gave a hissing sigh and ejected from its warm interior eight pieces of perfectly
            browned toast, eight eggs sunnyside up, sixteen slices of bacon, two coffees, and two cool glasses of milk.</span>
        <br>

            the fron door sang quietly: "Rain, rain, go away; rubbers, raincoats for today..." And the rain tapped on the
            empty house, echoing.</span>

        <span>At eight-thirty the eggs were shriveled and the toast was like stone. An aluminum wedge scraped them down a metal

        <span>Out of warrens in the wall, tiny robot mice darted. The rooms were acrawl with the small cleaning animals, all rubber
            and metal. They thudded against chairs, whirling their mustached runners, kneading the rug nap, sucking gently
            at hidden dust.&nbsp;Then, like mysterious invaders, they popped into their burrows. Their pink electric eye
            faded. The house was clean.</span>
        <br>
        <span>Ten o'clock. The sun came out from behind the rain. The house stood alone in a city of rubble and ashes. This was
            the one house left standing. At night the ruined city gave of a radioactive glow which could be seen for miles.
        </span>
        <br>
        <span>Ten-fifteen. The garden sprinklers whirled up in golden founts, filling the soft morning air with scatterings of
            brightness. The water pelted windowpanes, running down the charred west side where the house had been burned
            evenly free of its white paint. The entire west face of the house was black, save for five places. Here the silhouette
            in paint of a man mowing a lawn. Here, as in a photograph, a woman bent to pick flowers. Still farther over,
            their images burned on wood in one titantic instant, a small boy, hands flung into the air; higher up, the image
            of thrown ball, and opposite him a girl, hand raised to catch a ball which never came down.</span>

        <span>Until this day, how well the house had kept its peace. How carefully it had inquired, 'Who goes there? What's the
            password?" and, getting no answer from the only foxes and whining cats, it had shut up its windows and drawn
            shades in an old-maidenly preoccupation with self-protection which bordered on a mechanical paranoia.
        </span>
        <br>
        <span>It quivered at each sound, the house did. If a sparrow brushed a window, the shade snapped up. The bird, startled,
            flew off! No, not even a bird must touch the house!</span>
        <br>
        <span>The house was an altar with ten thousand attendants, big, small, servicing, attending, in choirs. But the gods had
            gone away, and the ritual of the religion continued senselessly, uselessly.

        <span>A dog whined, shivering, on the front porch. </span>
        <br>
        <span>The front door recognized the dog voice and opened. The dog, once large and fleshy, but now gone to bone and covered
            with sores, moved in and through the house, tracking mud. Behind it whirred angry mice, angry at having to pick
            up mud, angry at inconvenience.</span>
        <br>
        <span>For not a leaf fragment blew under the door but what the wall panels flipped open and the copper scrap rats flashed
            swiftly out. The offending dust, hair, or paper, seized in miniature steel jaws, was raced back to the burrows.
            There, down tubes which fed into the cellar, it was dropped like evil Baal in a dark corner.

        <span>It sniffed the air and scratched the kitchen door. Behind the door, the stove was making pancakes which filled the
            house with a rich odor and the scent of maple syrup.</span>
        <span>The dog frothed at the mouth, lying at the door, sniffing, its eyes turned to fire. It ran wildly in circles, biting
            at its tail, spun in a frenzy, and died. It lay in the parlor for an hour</span>

        <span>Two 'clock, sang a voice.</span>

        <br> Two thirty-five.

        <span>Bridge tables sprouted from patio walls. Playing cards fluttered onto pads in a shower of pips. Martinis manifested
            on an oaken bench with egg salad sandwiches. Music played.</span>

        <span>Animals took shape: yellow giraffes, blue lions, pink antelopes, lilac panthers cavorting in crystal substance. The
            walls were glass. They looked out upon color and fantasy. Hidden films clocked though the well-oiled sprockets,
            and the walls lived. The nursery floor was woven to resemble a crisp cereal meadow. Over this ran aluminum roaches
            and iron crickets, and in the hot still air butterflies of delicate red tissue wavered among the sharp aroma
            of animal spoors! There was the sound like a great matted yellow hive of bees within a dark bellows, the lazy
            bumble of a purring lion. And there was the patter of okapi feet and the murmur of a fresh jungle rain, like
            other hoofs falling upon the summer-starched grass. Now the walls dissolved into distances of parched weed, mile
            on mile, and warm endless sky. The animals drew away into thorn brakes and water holes</span>.</span>

        <span>The house gave ground as the fire in ten billion angry sparks moved with flaming ease from room to room and then

        <span>The fire crackled up the stairs. It fed upon Picassos and Matisses in the upper halls, like delicacies, baking off

        <span>The fire backed off, as even an elephant must at the sight of a dead snake. Now there were twenty snakes whipping
            over the floor, killing the fire with a clear cold venom of green froth.</span>
        <br>
        <span>But the fire was clever. It had sent flames outside the house, up through the attic to the pumps there. An explosion!
            The attic brain which directed the pumps was shattered into bronzeshrapnel on the beams.</span>

        Run, run! Heat snapped mirrors like the first brittle winter ice. And the voices wailed Fire, fire, run, run, like
        a tragic nursery rhyme, a dozen voices, high, low, like children dying in a forest, alone, alone. And the voices

        <span>Ten more voices died. In the last instant under the fire avalanche, other choruses, oblivious, could be heard announcing
            the time, playing music, cutting the lawn by remote-control mower, or setting an umbrella frantically out and
            in the slamming and opening front door, a thousand things happening, like a clock shop when each clock strikes
            the hour insanely before or after the other, a scene of maniac confusion, yet unity; singing, screaming, a few
            last cleaning mice darting bravely out to carry the horrid ashes away! And one voice, with sublime disregard
            for the situation, read poetry aloud all in the fiery study, until all the film spools burned, until all the
            wires withered and the circuits cracked.</span>

        <span>Dawn showed faintly in the east. Among the ruins, one wall stood alone. Within the wall, a last voice said, over
