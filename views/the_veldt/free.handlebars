<p>"George, I wish you'd look at the nursery."</p>
<p>"What's wrong with it?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Well, then."</p>
<p>"I just want you to look at it, is all, or call a psychologist in to look at it."</p>
<p>"What would a psychologist want with a nursery?"</p>
<p>"You know very well what he'd want." His wife paused in the middle of the kitchen and watched the stove busy humming to itself, making supper for four.</p>
<p>"It's just that the nursery is different now than it was."</p>
<p>"All right, let's have a look."</p>
<p>They walked down the hall of their soundproofed Happylife Home, which had cost them thirty thousand dollars installed, this house which clothed and fed and rocked them to sleep and played and sang and was good to them. Their approach sensitized a switch somewhere and the nursery light flicked on when they came within ten feet of it. Similarly, behind them, in the halls, lights went on and off as they left them behind, with a soft automaticity.</p>
<p>"Well," said George Hadley.</p>
